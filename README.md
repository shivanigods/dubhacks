SearchMate was inspired by our struggles as college students with technology, especially the frusteration of finding specific files or notes that are deeply buried in a sea of documents. To solve this struggle, not just for students but for all users who take advantage of their File System, we developed a desktop extension that allows users to quickly search for information without needing to know file or image names. This tool can also consolidate data across files and browser history, making it useful to create study guides or summaries. 

We built the backend with Python using CLIPModel for word embeddings and built the frontend with JavaScript and Electron. Through file indexing and utilizing Intel's NPU we were able to run everything locally, mitigating any security or privacy issues.
